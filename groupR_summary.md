The impact of patient clinical information on automated skin cancer detection. 

## A summary of the analysis 

Our data exploration aimed to assess how patient clinical information
impacts skin cancer detection, focusing on eight clinical features.

The analysis revealed distinct patterns between pigmented (NEV, MEL, SEK)
and non-pigmented lesions (ACK, BCC, SCC), particularly in terms of bleeding
and pain. Notably, ACK lesions generally do not cause pain, contrasting with
the often-painful SCC and BCC lesions.

The investigation into itching and patient age further differentiated
lesion types. Pigmented lesions tended to itch more frequently than their
non-pigmented counterparts. Age analysis showed a lower median age for NEV
compared to MEL and SEK, suggesting age as a useful discriminator for these
conditions. However, age did not significantly vary for ACK, SCC, and BCC,
indicating its limited predictive value for non-pigmented lesions. 

Prevalence of certain skin lesions across body regions have been found,
highlighting specific patterns, such as ACK's frequency on the forearm and
the commonality of NEV, SCC, BCC, MEL, and SEK on the face. Additional
feature analysis showed MEL and ACK rarely exhibit skin elevation, a
characteristic that sets them apart from other lesions. Pattern changes
were mostly associated with MEL, an essential marker for detecting this
cancer type. Although it was challenging to discern clear trends for recent
size increases, ACK notably lacked this feature.
